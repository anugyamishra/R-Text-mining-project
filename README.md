# R-Text-mining-project
The repository consists of two files: the R code for the text mining blog post and the knitted/rendered R document in a pdf format.

Project Description: As part of the course project for Complext Data Analytics course, I gathered human rights articles on AI from an online database and used text mining analyses to answer some research questions about the dataset.
